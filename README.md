In this Challenge, the completed code in python "krypto_jobs.py" enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments directly to fintech professionals via a platform called KryptoJobs2Go. 
The Front End is built using streamlit with Ganache as the ethereum blockchain wallet using Web3 libraries.

I only selected one of the FinTech professionals for this test which was Lane, and sent 2 transactions of 7.1 ETH and 27.16 ETH, as can be seen below.
